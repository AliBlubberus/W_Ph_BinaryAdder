A research-paper-style assignment for school. The task was to research about and realize a historically significant circuit involving semiconductors.
I chose to write about the binary adder, a logic-circuit performing the addition of two binary numbers, able to be daisy-chained to add numbers of any size.

Check out the mentioned literature that made this project possible!
